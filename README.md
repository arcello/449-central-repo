# FRC Team 449's Central Robot Code Library
This repo contains the library robot code. This code is built using gradle, and is included as a dependency by build season repos, like the [2016 build season repo](https://github.com/blair-robot-project/robot2016). After each build season, all of the non-robot-specific robot code is migrated to this repo for reuse in future build seasons.
